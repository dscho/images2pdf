# Create PDFs from images pasted into a web page

This is a simple web page to allow creating PDFs from images pasted into the page, adding one page per image, auto-scaling to A4 paper size.

The simplicity stems from the fact that [PDFKit](https://pdfkit.org/) so nicely hides away all the complexity.
